rails-app-with-protractor-functional-tests-and-code-coverage-report
=================================================

This repo contains a sample rails blog app with protractor functional tests in javascript and code coverage reported via a Grunt script.

1. Created a simple ruby on rails app for a blog following these instructions: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html
2. Created some functional tests in javascript under 'test' directory
3. Integrated Protractor framework for JS functional tests (https://github.com/angular/protractor). Note: this was integrated with a NON-ANGULAR app and it still worked.
4. Created a code coverage report via a Grunt script (http://gruntjs.com/)
